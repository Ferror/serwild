## A PHP framework to automate presentation layer
### Every developer has to create it's own framework - that's mine XD

### Module vs Plugin vs Component
* A module a quite generic terminology for a related set of classes that perform a task, and are usually bundled together.
* A plugin is, like its name says, a piece of software that you can plug into an application to provide new functionality. Plugins usually implement well defined API's and are reactive (that is, they provide services that the main application can use).
* A component is any piece of software designed to be reusable.
